    "essay": "Science has always been a catalyst for progress, revolutionizing various aspects of human existence. There is a prevailing notion that the primary objective of scientific endeavorsChange the spellingendeavoursshow examples should be to enhance the quality of life for individuals. While I largely agree with this perspective, I believe that science has multifaceted goals that go beyond mere improvements to human well-being. First and foremost, the most compelling argument for prioritizing the betterment of human life through science is the tangible impact it has on society. Advances in medical science, such as the development of vaccines and novel treatments, have significantly increased life expectancy and reduced the prevalence of many diseases. For instance, the discovery of antibiotics has revolutionized the treatment of bacterial infections, saving countless lives. Moreover, scientific innovations in agriculture have led to the creation of high-yield crops, which are essential in combating hunger and ensuring food security worldwide. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that science serves broader purposes beyond immediate human benefits. Fundamental research, which may not have immediate practical applications, often lays the groundwork for future breakthroughs. The study of quantum mechanics, for example, initially seemed abstract and detached from everyday concerns but has since paved the way for advancements in technologies such as semiconductors and quantum computing. Such research illustrates that the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake can eventually lead to significant enhancements in people's lives. Furthermore, science also plays a pivotal role in addressing global challenges that extend beyond individual well-being. Environmental science, for instance, is crucial in understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change. The development of sustainable technologies and conservation strategies aims not only to protect human populations but also to preserve ecosystems for future generations. This broader approach underscores that the aims of science should encompass the health of the planet and all its inhabitants, not solely human welfare. In conclusion, while the enhancement of human life should indeed be a paramount goal of scientific research, it is equally important to recognize the value of fundamental science and the broader impact it can have on global issues. Therefore, I believe that science should strive to balance immediate benefits with long-term goals, ensuring that its contributions are both profound and enduring.",

    "essay": "In this modern world, the usage of technology is constantly on the rise. Everyone nowadays equips themselves with a smartphone as an all-in-one device for both work and entertainment needs. It is disagreed that the rise of mobile phone users is leading to many social problems. Analysing the development of telecommunication systems, as well as the many benefits of smartphones will prove this. Firstly, the rise of telecommunication systems has reduced the distance of connection between people around the world. For instance, family members can easily connect to their loved ones in any corner of the world with a simple phone call. Additionally, with the growth of the Internet, phone calls can be upgraded to video calls, where people can share their experiences from a place they are currently visiting while talking to their friends at the same time. As a result, writing letters and sending postcards are being replaced by social network posting and high-quality video-sharing platforms. Secondly, it is undeniable that smartphones nowadays can replace many personal needs from work to entertainment. For example, we can take a bus to school while listening to our favourite song on the phone at the same time. Furthermore, with the vast resources on the Internet nowadays, smartphones have become our gateway to the world with a simple tap on the screen. Therefore, the benefits smartphones bring to humans outweigh their drawbacks. In conclusion, the rise of mobile phone use is an inevitable trend as it was a result of many years of the development of telecom networks and the adaption of users' behaviour. Therefore, the idea of social problems caused by mobile phones cannot be supported. After a thorough analysis of this subject, it is predicted that this trend will continue to rise in the future and smartphone users will only increase year by year.",

In this essay, I will argue both opinions about the matter above. There is an expression that says, if money can not bring you happiness, poverty definitely can make you an unhappy person. Although all rich people are not happy, most poor people are unpleasure. For instance, in developing countries, individuals have to pay more money for their daily expenditures. This might put them under pressure to provide a logical and comfortable life, consequently, more work time can steal the delight from their life. On the other hand, other people believe that even being a rich person can not guarantee joy for individuals, because other factors like a good partner, environment, health, and having enough free time are directly affecting our happiness. For example, if somebody has an incurable disease, economic success can not help him/her to find joy. There are a lot of wealthy people that are seeking a small amount of comfort in their life and some of them can not be bought, even with a high vast of money.

    "essay": "Some argue that the best way to make traffic safer is by introducing lower speed limits for vehicles, whilst others believe that there may be better ways to achieve the same goal. While lower speed limits will, undoubtedly, contribute to better road safety, a more effective alternative can be to improve the overall construction of vehicles to absorb more damage before reaching the driver and passengers. On the one hand, decreasing speed limits is, undeniably, a logical solution to reduce the number and negative effects of collisions. It is common knowledge that vehicles that collide while going slower will inflict less damage to each other, and consequently, the people within them. Furthermore, a slower flow of traffic will give drivers more reaction time to prevent crashes when faced with an unexpected situation. For instance, two trucks colliding at 90 kilometres per hour will receive far less damage than trucks that collide at 160 kilometres per hour. Nevertheless, although this may be an effective solution, it will also prolong the time it takes to travel around, which will make transportation far less efficient and more costly for businesses. On the other hand, improving the construction of vehicles to make them safer will not only reduce the chances of injury,Remove the commaapplyshow examples but, unlike the aforementioned alternative, will not hinder the time it takes to go from one place to another. Using more steel within the motor block, installing stronger windshields, and adding more airbags to automobiles are all ways to ensure passengers are better protected in the case of a collision. These will not only make vehicles safer,Remove the commaapplyshow examples but increase their overall quality and reliability. For example, Volvo, a Swiss car manufacturer, is famous for producing cars that can withstand a huge amount of damage without affecting the passengers.

Conversely, Fiat is notorious for making weak and unsafe vehicles. Likewise, this is due to the manufacturer using cheaper, malliableCorrect your spellingmalleable steel at the front.

Although it is true that studying only the main subjects can be boring, in order to vary, additional subjects should be added. It is also true that if we have other subjects, it may take our time, so studAdd an articlethe studa studshow examples ents may not spend enough time on their qualifications. There are a number of reasons why students want to add additional subjects in addition to their main subjects. Firstly, being restricted only to main subjects can be overwhelming and boring, as studying specific subjects on a daily basis can be really hard for students, so there should be some differences, like additional subjects. Furthermore, it can boost students' overall performance in main subjects, as by diversifying additional subjects, they may feel more relaxed and will not get bored easily, as they are not concentrated only on main subjects. For example, research held by scientists at Harvard University says that students get less tired or bored because additional subjects are added. Thus, as it helps students to improve their studies, it would be good if additional subjects were added. On the other hand, it may cause some serious problems for students' main concern. Studying more subjects in addition to their main subjects can be hard, as they might allocate more attention to additional subjects and forget about their main subjects that would be needed in the future for their qualification. For instance, from my experience, I can say that it is really hard to study different subjects at once. Additionally, it is not effective, as students will not have enough time to study their main subjects. Hence, studying additional subjects may grab students' attention so that they might forget their main concern. In conclusion, while it is true that additional subjects may benefit students' performance, it also can affect them negatively, as they will not have enough time for their main subjects. In my opinion, students should only concentrate on their main subjects in order to master their qualifications.",

    "essay": "A topic of debate among students in higher education is that some feel that studying the specialization itself is boring for students and they should study other subjects as well, while others feel that it is for their field. I partially agree with both of them. Nowadays, there is a lot of protest in the higher education system that students are taught subjects that do not belong to their field. Some students believe that only special subjects are necessary and other subjects are not necessary. If students are taught only subjects relevant to their field, they will have the opportunity to better learn this field and apply their knowledge in this field. Therefore, only if more students are taught subjects related to their specializations in universities, they can produce field experts and more useful employees. On the other hand, there is also a second idea, which says that other subjects should be taught together with special subjects. In this way, the students will be encouraged to study and research more, to work more on themselves. This will help them expand their worldview and gain knowledge in other areas. In addition, Exposure to various disciplines fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills by providing different perspectives. Combining knowledge from different fields can lead to innovative solutions and new ideas. Studying diverse subjects can enhance personal growth, cultural awareness, and intellectual curiosity.Therefore, studying other subjects together with special subjects gives students more opportunities. In conclusion, special subjects and additionallyChange the wordadditionalshow examples subjects should be taught equally in universities. Only special subjects should be studied more deeply than other subjects.",

    "essay": "In the contemporary era, television and newspapers provide easy access to a wide range of news, and news editors play a key role in producing coverage. Therefore, this essay will explore the factors that may impact their decisions and shed light on whether people become accustomed to bad news and whether we should have more good news. There are several factors that may affect editors' choices in coverage. Firstly, they will consider the audience's interests and needs to ensure that the content they choose will attract viewers or readers. Moreover, they also evaluate the timeliness and significance of the news. Even more importantly, political and commercial interests play a significant role. Regarding whether people have become accustomed to bad news, many individuals still find it difficult to adapt.For instance,negative coverage of issues such as climate change, wars, and other serious topics is unavoidable and continues to cause a sense of insecurity, leading people to feel anxious and overwhelmed.Despite this, such news is important for maintaining awareness and addressing global issues. On the other hand, when editors report more positive news, it can create a better and more joyful atmosphere. This, in turn, makes it easier for people to immerse themselves in a positive environment and find peace of mind. In conclusion, there are several factors that impact editors' choice of coverage, including viewers' interests, time-sensitive aspects, and vested interests. Additionally, bad news is still difficult for people to get used to. In contrast, when people are exposed to more good news, it leads to an enhancement of well-being and mental health, which are pivotal components of individuals' lives.",

    "essay": "In contemporary times, the lifespan of humanity has significantly increased. However, this essay argues that this phenomenon causes a heavier burden on government services, particularly in terms of environment and health Therefore, raising taxes may be an appropriate measure to alleviate this stress. One primary reason is that a larger population would lead to some environmental issues. These problems might make governments need to pay more attention to dealing with them, gradually accumulating more pressure. For instance, in Beijing, as their population is overcrowded, the local environment cannot endure this situation, ultimately resulting in various pollution, such as air, water, noise pollution and considerably exacerbating. Consequently, China’s government will face more economic challenges to solve the pollution. Another crucial reason is that the older population may cause more medical issues. Inevitably, with age growing, the elderly may face more diseases, especially cancer. For example, in many developed countries like Taiwan and Japan, the majority of diseases in the old group are cancer. To alleviate patients’ symptoms, governments must support a substantial number of medical resources to address it. In addition, the manpower of hospitals is another problem, which cannot suffer an excessive number of patients and usually overworking. Accordingly, both challenges are governments need to deal with, increasing their financial pressures. In order to solve these difficulties, raising adequate taxes may be an appropriate method, while it may cause individuals’ financial pressures to increase slightly. With more financial support, governments can solve these difficulties more flexibly, thereby making the public satisfied. A typical example is in West developed countries. In general, although their taxes are heavier than in Eastern countries, they establish more comprehensive measures to assist their public. For instance, their government give temporary accommodations for those who have some financial problems. Furthermore, they encourage volunteers to help the elderly or patients cultivate a more optimistic attitude to confront their life or diseases. As a result, raising taxes can effectively improve the pressures on governments, providing a positive cycle in society. In conclusion, current governments indeed face numerous difficulties such as environmental and medical aspects due to the longer lifespan. To alleviate these circumstances, increasing suitable taxes may be accessible.",

    "essay": "Some argue that insufficient infrastructure can be an obstacle for less-developed countries to improve and modernize. Likewise, the same people believe that this should be the first issue to be resolved with outside funding. While there are, undoubtedly, other critical matters that can be resolved with foreign aid, infrastructure is clearly the most important one because improving it will help slash transit costs for all businesses within the country, and will expedite the speed inChange prepositionatshow examples which goods and services are delivered. Firstly, improving the quality of roads and tracks will cut transportation costs for all companies within the country by reducing the time and fuel it requires to go from one place to another. Thanks to this, companies will pay a smaller portion of their revenue to fuel and drivers which will increase their net profits. Undoubtedly, the best example of this is the Bosphorus Bridge in Istanbul, Turkey. Before its inception, vehicles had to cross the Bosphorus via boats, which were unreliable and costly, both in terms of time and money. Thus, by putting up the bridge, the Ottoman state was able to remedy this, and consequently, reduce the transit costs for all establishments within the constituency. Moreover, bolstering the quality of infrastructure will increase the speed inChange prepositionatshow examples which products and services can be delivered. Dirt roads and meandering tracks are notorious for massively prolonging the time it takes to get around. Therefore, by allocating foreign funding to improving these, nations can streamline transportation and make it much less time-consuming. For instance, the trip from Istanbul to Bursa used to take around eight hours despite the two cities being less than 300 kilometersChange the spellingkilometresshow examples away from eachotherCorrect your spellingeach other. To remedy this, the Turkish government put up the Orhangazi Bridge, which helped slash the time it took to three hours, and thus, cut down transit time by seven hours. To sum up, the allocation of foreign aid is a controversial topic within less-developed countries. And, even though some may argue that it could be better utilized in areas like education or healthcare, it is certain that solid infrastructural foundations will provide the highest benefits for the development of these states.",

    "essay": "Some people claim that good health plays a crucial role in their lives. Therefore, there is a debate that private hospitals should not provide medical services. Although this scenario can offer several merits and demerits, this essay will argue that the benefits of this eclipsed the drawbacks. On the one hand, private hospitals also cause several shortcomings. Given that the private centre provides convenient medical services, the patients have to pay exorbitant costs. By doing this, patients must expend high bills, which is not suitable for poor people especially those without medical insurance. Moreover, social inequalities for applying medical services increase because some poor residents can not afford expensive costs. For instance, people who own rich property can receive prompt and high-quality care, however, others only face lower services in the public category. This leads to discrimination in people's services even untimely treatment in emergency situations. On the other hand, despite the detrimental aspects, the private healthcare centre brings some positive aspects. First, it can reduce the workload of public medical hospitals. With the appearance of many private companies, the number of patients going to the public will decrease. This can result in a decrease in the experience of waiting times of inhabitants who make an appointment with doctors as well as reduce the shortage of experts about health. Another advantage is that the private healthcare company gives more opportunities for patients to access cutting-edge quality services and professionals from specific fields immediately depending on their excellent financial resources. This hospital tends to invest more money in improving modern amenities with state-of-the-art equipment and technologies, which allows patients to receive top medical procedures and treatments than the public centre. In conclusion, while private healthcare offers some disadvantages such as high cost and healthcare inequalities, these will bring more advantages including reducing the workload or advanced technologies. It seems to me that the merits are more considerable than its demerits.",

    "essay": "There are several factors that motivate people to remain in the workforce, and it is often argued that money is the most significant reason. While I acknowledge that financial incentives play a crucial role, I believe that other factors such as work-life balance, job satisfaction, and a supportive work environment are equally important. To begin with, it is undeniable that money is a powerful motivator for many individuals. Financial stability is essential for meeting basic needs, supporting families, and achieving personal goals. For instance, in developing countries, where the cost of living can be high, employees often prioritize higher salaries to ensure their financial security. Additionally, monetary rewards such as bonuses, raises, and promotions are effective tools for retaining talent and encouraging productivity. However, focusing solely on financial incentives overlooks the importance of non-monetary factors. Work-life balance, for instance, is increasingly valued by employees who seek to manage their professional and personal lives effectively. Companies that offer flexible working hours, remote work options, and generous leave policies tend to attract and retain employees who prioritize their well-being over financial gains. For example, in countries like Denmark and Sweden, where work-life balance is highly emphasized, job satisfaction rates are among the highest in the world. Moreover, a positive work environment and job satisfaction are critical in motivating employees to stay. People are more likely to remain in their jobs if they feel valued, supported, and engaged. Factors such as a collaborative workplace culture, opportunities for professional growth, and recognition of achievements contribute significantly to job satisfaction. For example, Google is renowned for its supportive work environment, which includes various employee benefits and development programs, leading to high employee retention rates. In conclusion, while financial incentives are undoubtedly important in motivating individuals to stay in the workforce, other factors such as work-life balance, job satisfaction, and a supportive work environment are equally vital. A comprehensive approach that addresses both monetary and non-monetary needs is essential for fostering employee loyalty and satisfaction.",

    "essay": "It is believed that money is the main reason that motivates a person to stay working for the same company. I disagree with this opinion, and I think that job security and better career growth prospects are the main reasons for an individual to work for the same company for a longer duration. It is evident from many surveys that job security is the main concern for an employee in the rapidly changing world. Every employee would like to feel secure in their job. For example, if an employee is not working with the same team for a longer period, then he will not be able to become the core member of that working team. If you are not one of the main members of a project team, then you will be always considered a supporting member and you can be easily removed from the team for any reason and end up losing your job. Therefore, a person prefers to stay with the same organisation for many years. The other potential reason for staff to work in the same organisation is better career growth. For example, if Correct word choiceapplyshow examplesyou have noticed that major companies like TATA, HSBC, etc, would like to consider only their employees for important positions like CEO, CFO, MD, etc. These companies won't prefer to hire outsiders for these key designations. Therefore, if an employee stays with the same company for a considerable duration, then he has a higher chance of reaching these top positions. As I explained above, there are many reasons that can motivate a person to work for the same organisation and I believe money is not the main reason.",

This essay will explain the disadvantages and the advantages of this idea and I believe the advantages can outweigh the disadvantegsCorrect your spellingdisadvantages. To begin with the disadvantages, a crucial disadvantage is demolishing cost. These costs include workforces, machines, fuels and waste. For example, regarding old buildings, this cost is often quite high and it can take over 10 million yen. According to an article, about one-third of city governments in Japan are suffering from a shortage of money because of the plan which proceeds to demolish old buildings. If we stop this plan, we can allocate more funds to the other essential fields, education or health care, for instance. However, there are significant advantages; to make more space and keep safe for residents. With regard to the former, we will need more space to deal with overpopulation in the future. Osaka city, which is one of the largest cities in Japan, is predicted to increase its population twice within 30 years. Therefore, we should break down old buildings and build new ones where more and more people live . As for the latter, old buildings are likely not to fulfil the rule of housing. Many old buildings built over 50 years ago cannot be enough strong to live in. If there is a big earthquake, these buildings will break down immediately and may harm citizens because of their poles or windows. Consequently, it is important to replace old buildings to keep them safe in an emergency. In conclusion, although there are clear disadvantages to knocking down old buildings, I believe that these disadvantages are outweighed by the advantages.",

This essay will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of using technology for communication. First and foremost, technology has been developed over many years by inventors and developers to help and ease human activities, especially when individuals need to connect with others over long distances. To address this challenge, technology provides efficient and effective ways to communicate. People can now easily engage and socialize with acquaintances, clients, friends, and family using gadgets and computers, regardless of the distance. For example, video conferencing allows business meetings to take place without the need for travel, saving time and resources. However, this reliance on technology for communication can have negative impacts if not used wisely. Overuse of gadgets can lead to neglecting significant real-world relationships as people become overly focused on their devices. This can result in missed opportunities and diminished social skills. For instance, individuals might minimize face-to-face meetings, assuming virtual interactions are sufficient. In reality, offline meetings help people become more active, improve their soft skills through practicingChange the spellingpractisingshow examples public speaking, and build confidence in conversations that virtual interactions cannot fully replicate. In conclusion, using technology for communication can be highly beneficial when it makes our lives more efficient and connects us over long distances.

By using technology wisely and prioritizing face-to-face connections, individuals can enhance their lives and future opportunities.",

    "essay": "Compared to earlier periods, many current foods and drinks products contain overabundant sugar, causing some health problems. In this essay, I agree that the price of sugary goods should be higher, thereby helping customers consume less sugar. One crucial reason to support this approach is that enhancing the price of sugary products is more likely to diminish the interest of customers to purchase them. This ensures that consumers can avoid some diseases, especially those related to sugar. For instance, many medical experts have indicated that absorbing excessive sugar has a higher likelihood of leading to obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. To improve these symptoms, the more efficient solution is decreasing the use of sugar. Consequently, utilizing higher prices to prevent consumers' desires for sugar may be a reasonable measure. While there are still some customers who persist in purchasing high levels of sugar goods or are even addicted to sugar, more expensive prices of these products indeed be a more effective approach to restrict people's consumption habits. Additionally, losing interest in sugary goods implies that customers may be more willing to purchase, such as vegetables, proteins, and other healthier products. With more comprehensive to absorb nutrients, customers could address some sugary problems, helping their bodies become healthier. To sum up, I firmly agree that controlling the prices of sugary products can encourage people to consume less sugar. This measure not only decreases the attention of individuals with sugar but also increases the likelihood of becoming healthier. Although some individuals still do not care about prices, this method can indeed improve the use of sugar significantly.",

    "essay": "The world’s population has been increasing, and it is considered the greatest problem that humanity has ever experienced at present time. Since world wars do not happen, the population rate of the world has been growing, and I think this is the worst problem ever. World wars were the main reason for the decline of people’s living in the past twentieth century. The First and Second World Wars extremely caused huge mortality rates in the whole earth. As a lot of money and food were required for warfare, the other people could not eat enough food, and they died. However, after those wars were ended and all resources were available for human living, the birth percentage started growing year by year for hundreds of years. Consequently, ending conflicts and bringing peace are the main reasons for the growth percentage. In recent decades, an increase of over eight billion people is the real worst issue for humanity. To be more clear, the reason overpopulation is an issue for many countries is that they demand many resources for living, such as food, clothes, technologies, fossil fuels, and so on. To meet those needs, companies and manufacturers make a lot of products, so their factories significantly affect environmental problems, for example, global warming, melting icebergs, lack of water, etc . To sum up, having good living conditions and peace are the main causes of overpopulation, and I totally agree with the idea that the growth of the birth rate is the greatest problem.",

    "essay": "The question of whether to apply more expensive value to rich sugar-contained products is worthy of debate. Some people argue that it isn't a reasonable way to solve the problem. However, I agree with the suggestion because it can ultimately lead to a nation's profitability. Firstly, imposing a high price on sugary products can hinder people from buying them. Take a cigarette as an example. Many nations make an extraordinary effort to boost their public's well-being followed by setting an expensive price on cigarettes by adding an enormous tax to prevent smokers from smoking. As a result, smokers are inevitably forced to stop smoking because they cannot afford to handle its tremendous price anymore. Moreover, this movement can trigger many companies to develop sugar-free products and alternative foods. There are increasing concerns that adult diseases like obesity and diabetes are damaging modern society. While some companies struggle to recover theChange prepositionfrom theshow examples economic crisis resulting from the policy of putting the Correct article usageapplyshow exampleshigh prices on their sugary food, others can overcome this circumstance by introducing salubrious food products. It can not only avert the financial depression but also earn an eclectic level of customers who bolster the policy for their health. To recapitulate, increasing the price of sugary products will be conducive to consuming less sugar. Adapting to the new phases resulting from changes such as an improvement in health self-consciousness plays a significant role in the prosperity of nations and organizations. Furthermore, investment in the health industry can be an integral element of a thriving and vibrant society that contributes to the well-being of the nation.",

    "essay": "Modern days , technology has developed in many fields specifically the transportation sector . Some people believe that in the next few years , all transportation vehicles will be without drivers and in cars, buses and trucks there will be only travellers . This phenomenon has both pros and cons but this essay will contend that , on balance ,the advantages of driverless vehicles outweigh the negatives. Let us begin by looking at the benefits of modern vehicles. One of the main positives is that driverless metro trains reduce human errors and also travel time . What I mean to say is that metro trains decrease the chances of accidents and travel time because they are controlled by a computer system . For example, in 2023 , in Pakistan, our honourable Prime Minister Imran Khan inaugurated the first driverless train in the national capital Islamabad . The launch of this train has benefited millions of people as it ensures their safety . Moreover, in driverless trains, vacationers feel safe because in some cases there may be only one or two passengers. For instance, in India , in 2012 , an incident happened which is called Nahribi because a bus driver attempted rape to a woman utilizing the benefit of his loneliness. On the other hand , there are certain demerits of metro trains . One of the most significant drawbacks is the lack of jobs because people who earn money by driving buses and trains will become jobless.Thus , the unemployment rate rises . Furthermore, these vehicles have made the journey convenient for the public and this feature makes people tempted to buy . Thus , more vehicles will cause more air and noise pollution which is also detrimental to society. To conclude, some individuals say that in future all vehicles will become driverless . This change has both positives such as safetyCorrect article usagethe safetyshow examples of passengers and negatives such as environmental issues and lack of jobs .By considering the above reasons, I firmly believe that the advantages of metro trains out the disadvantages.",

    "essay": "Some individuals tend to do hazardous sports, such as bungee jumping and scuba diving. It is necessary to consider that these participants should be responsible for their own lives and lifeguards should not take risks to save them. I strongly disagree with this point of view. In the forthcoming paragraphs, I shall elaborate on the reasons and discuss my opinion more. Firstly, it is obvious that if we do threatening activities, such as paragliding, we have to hire an expert coach as a professional guard in terms of safety responsibility. Secondly, it is crucial to know how we can manage risky situations. So, it would be a great idea if we encountered these circumstances with well-trained rescuers to avoid uncontrollable conditions. For example, in the USA, it is vital that if you have a plan for adventurous activities, you have to employ a professional guide since it will monitor risky actions. On the other hand, critics assume that we have to save our lives without paying attention to others. However, I totally disagree with this idea. It is essential to focus on how we will be able to improve security levels. In other words, some activities, such as bungee jumping need extra actions as they will guarantee our lives. Thus, it is undeniable that the lifeguards have an important role in this matter. For instance, in India, if you choose to do bungee jumping, you will not be responsible for checking ropes as it is the rescuer's responsibility. In conclusion, it is clear that we need expert individuals who will be able to decrease risks in terms of safety and security. Also, I strongly disagree that we have to do dangerous sports without lifeguards.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, students' behaviour has become one of the problems that are starting to bloom in schools. Therefore, in this essay, I will discuss what has caused this issue and present some measures that can be taken to prevent this problem from happening in the near future. One of the primary causes for students' behavioural problems is stress which can occur from their families, schools even their friends. In the modern world, there are a lot of improvements needed to fasten or get everything done effectively. If we do not achieve it, stress feeling will be embarking real soon. The same things can be found in school life, stress haunts children, especially those who are less talented compared to others. Last but not least, wrong teaching methods can lead to students' behaviour problems too because this error will be imitated by our children which can lead them to do the wrong thing. There are some solutions that we can do to minimize students’ behaviour problems. Firstly, we must prepare a refreshing time for children because, during this time, they can do their hobbies or explore their potential more freely. Besides, that, their mind can be calmer causing them to be more relaxed and reduce tensions in their mind. Secondly, we must observe our children’s behaviours, we must teach them how to behave so they will not deviate in the upcoming years. In conclusion, students' behaviour problems problems come from stresses caused by their circle and wrong teaching methods. To reduce these causes, we must prepare for a refreshing time and provide a good teaching method.",

    "essay": "People have diverse opinions regarding whether teachers should set homework for students. While some individuals consider it to be an unnecessary burden on school children, I contend that assigning a certain amount of out-of-class assignments has a positive effect on both their academic performance and personal development. There are several reasons why opponents believe that young learners should not be given extra work after school. Firstly, based on the results of doing assignments, some educationists have found that these tasks play a negligible role in enhancing pupils’ exam grades, making them a heavy load rather than a facilitator. Moreover, many parents point out that their children are required to stay at school and study for a long time, leaving them less time to continue their education at home. Additionally, it is undeniable that leisure time is as valuable as study time; ‘All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy’. Therefore, after a hard day at school, youngsters deserve to engage in recreational activities such as participating in sports, playing instruments, and doing crafts, which are beneficial for their comprehensive growth. Despite these arguments, I maintain that the advantages of completing after-school assignments outweigh the disadvantages. One of the main benefits is that these exercises can significantly help pupils consolidate what they have learned in class, thereby giving them a deeper understanding of the material. Furthermore, to complete various projects in different subjects on time, young people need to learn how to make an appropriate schedule, which can improve their self-discipline, develop time management and problem-solving skills, and prepare them to be productive workers as adults. In fact, with the promotion of educational reform, many countries have implemented new policies to ensure children have more spare time and a limited number of academic tasks after school, making the setting of these assignments more reasonable. In conclusion, while it is understandable why some people argue against assigning work when students come home from school, I argue that the benefits of these assignments outweigh the drawbacks.",

    "essay": "Modern days , technology has developed in many fields specifically the transportation sector . Some people believe that in the next few years , all transportation vehicles will be without drivers and in cars, buses and trucks there will be only travellers . This phenomenon has both pros and cons but this essay will contend that , on balance ,the advantages of driverless vehicles outweigh the negatives. Let us begin by looking at the benefits of modern vehicles. One of the main positives is that driverless metro trains reduce human errors and also travel time . What I mean to say is that metro trains decrease the chances of accidents and travel time because they are controlled by a computer system . For example, in 2023 , in Pakistan, our honourable Prime Minister Imran Khan inaugurated the first driverless train in the national capital Islamabad . The launch of this train has benefited millions of people as it ensures their safety . Moreover, in driverless trains, vacationers feel safe because in some cases there may be only one or two passengers. For instance, in India , in 2012 , an incident happened which is called Nahribi because a bus driver attempted rape to a woman utilizing the benefit of his loneliness. On the other hand , there are certain demerits of metro trains . One of the most significant drawbacks is the lack of jobs because people who earn money by driving buses and trains will become jobless.Thus , the unemployment rate rises .Furthermore, these vehicles have made the journey convenient for the public and this feature makes people tempted to buy . Thus , more vehicles will cause more air and noise pollution which is also detrimental to society. To conclude, some individuals say that in future all vehicles will become driverless . This change has both positives and negatives.By considering the above reasons, I firmly believe that the advantages of metro trains out the disadvantages.",

    "essay": "The design of cities to be attractive for both local residents and foreign tourists is a topic of considerable debate. While some argue that urban planning should prioritize the needs of the local population, others believe that appealing to tourists is equally important. I agree that cities should be designed to cater to both groups, as this approach can bring numerous economic, social, and cultural benefits. Firstly, making cities attractive to foreign tourists can significantly boost the local economy. Tourism generates substantial revenue through spending on accommodation, dining, shopping, and entertainment. For instance, cities like Paris and New York, which are designed to attract tourists, benefit from millions of visitors each year, contributing to local businesses and job creation. This influx of tourists can stimulate economic growth and provide a steady income stream for local residents. Moreover, designing cities with tourists in mind often leads to the development of better infrastructure and services that also benefit local people. For example, the creation of efficient public transportation systems, well-maintained parks, and cultural attractions can enhance the quality of life for residents. Improved infrastructure makes daily commutes easier and provides recreational spaces that locals can enjoy. Additionally, the presence of tourists can encourage cities to maintain higher standards of cleanliness and safety, creating a more pleasant environment for everyone. On the other hand, it is crucial that the needs and preferences of local residents are not overshadowed by efforts to attract tourists. Urban planning should ensure that local people have access to affordable housing, healthcare, education, and other essential services. Cities should also preserve their unique cultural heritage and identity, rather than solely catering to tourist expectations. For instance, while developing areas of historical and cultural significance for tourism, it is important to involve local communities in decision-making to ensure their interests are protected. Furthermore, a balanced approach can help foster a sense of pride and belonging among local residents. When cities are designed to highlight their cultural heritage and natural beauty, residents can feel proud of their hometown, which can enhance community cohesion and social well-being. At the same time, tourists can have authentic and enriching experiences, learning about the local culture and traditions. In conclusion, I believe that cities should be designed to be attractive forChange prepositiontoshow examples both local people and foreign tourists. This dual approach can lead to economic growth, improved infrastructure, and a higher quality of life for residents, while also preserving the city's cultural identity. By balancing the needs of locals and tourists, cities can create vibrant, inclusive, and sustainable urban environments.",

    "essay": "In contemporary urban planning, the debate between utilizing vacant areas in cities and towns for planting trees or building housing facilities is highly contentious. While both perspectives have their merits, I strongly believe that planting trees should be prioritized in these spaces due to the significant environmental and social benefits they offer. Firstly, trees play a crucial role in improving urban air quality. They absorb pollutants such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides, and produce oxygen, making the air cleaner and healthier for city dwellers. For instance, studies have shown that urban areas with abundant tree cover experience lower levels of air pollution compared to those with fewer trees. This reduction in pollution can lead to better respiratory health for residents, particularly children and the elderly. Moreover, trees help mitigate the urban heat island effect. Cities are often significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas due to the high concentration of buildings and asphalt, which absorb and retain heat. Trees provide shade and release moisture through a process called transpiration, cooling the air and making urban environments more comfortable during hot weather. For example, shaded streets and parks can be several degrees cooler than unshaded areas, providing much-needed relief during summerCorrect article usagethe summershow examples months. In addition to environmental benefits, trees enhance the aesthetic appeal and livability of urban spaces. Green areas with trees offer residents a place to relax, exercise, and socialize, contributing to overall well-being and community cohesion. Parks and tree-lined streets can also increase property values and attract tourists, boosting the local economy. On the other hand, it is undeniable that there is a pressing need for housing in many urban areas, especially with growing populations. However, building housing at the expense of green spaces can lead to overcrowding and further exacerbate environmental problems. A balanced approach is necessary, where urban planning includes both adequate housing and the preservation and expansion of green spaces. In conclusion, while the construction of housing facilities is essential, the environmental and social advantages of planting trees in vacant urban areas cannot be overlooked. Prioritizing green spaces in cities and towns not only addresses immediate environmental concerns but also enhances the quality of life for residents. Therefore, I believe that planting trees should take precedence over building housing in vacant urban areas.",

    "essay": "In recent times students have been burdened with studies. Therefore, some people feel that after school, children should spend time with their favourite activities and enjoy their lives. Some humankind thinks totally opposite. They think students have to do extracurricular things apart from their studies. In this matter, I would like to discuss both views and give my opinion in upcoming paragraphs. Some folk deem that every age offspring take extra responsibilities. The reason behind this is they feel that if students help their parents at their Correct pronoun usageapplyshow exampleshome by giving a helping hand with house chores as well as doing learning by helping their fathers at the effort. By this, I mean that it will help offspring develop their physical stability and they also become well at multitasking. Resultantly, children's cognition and physical development will increase. Moreover, youngsters do not face difficulties in their upcoming lives if they go away from their comfort zone. For example, children in India do all household activities and also help their parents in business. Thus, when they go to foreign countries they do not feel any struggle to do any kind of job. Nonetheless, some mankind believe that in this competitive era, students already have a study burden on their shoulders. Tacitly, students do study for 8-10 hours in a day and they become exhausted. To give immunity to my viewpoint, after school students do not have the energy to do other tasks and it is parents duty that they give time for relaxation to their children. Furthermore, Encouragement to do their favourite activities should be done by parents. As a consequence, children can focus on their studies otherwise they become irritated and depressed by another workload. For Instance, In the US parents know the balance between study life and work life. Ergo, they give dates to their children to grow properly. Families in this country are against child labour jobFix the agreement mistakejobsshow examples. To conclude, people have to understand children and not give them the burden of other work as it reduces their physical growth. However, we can not deny that knowledge about household work and office work is also important. So, people should equally divide time for youth to play and work.",

First, the pre-manufacturing stage begins when the three main ingredients, such as flour, water, and yeast are poured into an industrial mixer to be mixed evenly. After the raw ingredients are mixed, the dough will enter the production stage. In this phase, the dough is fermented either naturally or by adding additives in a glass jar with a solid lid. Then, it will be processed in a dividing machine to be divided into pre-determined weights. Next, it is pushed by a plunger so that it moves to the rotating cylinder to be shaped into a round form perfectly. Lastly, in the post-production stage, the finished dough is forwarded to a conveyor belt for further processing. In conclusion, the process of bread dough manufacture is a simple one that is capital intensive.",

However, this transition also cautioned against the danger that rapid change could have on societies. Personally, I absolutely agree with this viewpoint, which will be further discussed in the following essay. On the one hand, these modern inventions have brought some positive impacts towards a nation, acknowledged as economic growth, healthcare improvements job automation etc. To be specific, widespread access to the internet has revolutionized our world, transforming how we communicate, learn, work, shop and even socialize. In addition, modern methods have paved the way for automation, resulting in reduced labour work and improved productivity. To illustrate, centuries ago, more goods were handmade, which require more workers and time, nowadays many manufacturers have taken advantage of automatic machines to mass produce products with consistent quality and in a relatively short time. As a result, not only has the workload can be done faster and more effectively, but the quality of life has also been improved. On the other hand, while automation has the power to unlock unimaginable benefits to communityFix the agreement mistakecommunitiesshow examples and nationFix the agreement mistakenationsshow examples, it also has the power to disrupt systems and potentially devastate societies. The rate of technological development and availability threatens to outpace the rate at which societies and governments are able to adapt to it. In China, for example, 77% of Chinese jobs were at risk of automation in 2016, meaning that as machinery develops, hundreds of thousands of folk could be replaced by machinery without alternative employment opportunities. Moreover, the lack of face-to-face communication is also one of technology's negative impacts. Having seen each other on social apps already, people become more hesitant to meet physically. Some teenagers even want to have virtual friends more than mix with their real-life ones. In the long run, this can lead to a serious decrease in social interactions as well as communication skills as well as characteristics such as empathy and mindfulness. As a consequence, populationAdd an articlethe populationshow examples will end up being emotionless and lacking genuine relationships, which can be extremely harmful to the well-being of human society. In conclusion, while it is true that technological advances have brought numerous benefits to human lives, I also agree that the consequences along with them are considerable.",

    "essay": "In the contemporary interconnected world, the technical development trend has unprecedented repercussions on writing habits, leading to the argument that the practicality of calligrapher practices by hand should be obsoleted, whereas other critics believe handwriting still renders a vital part of essential stills. This essay will explore both viewpoints and present my perspective that manual writing is still indispensable. Proponents of digital alternatives could serve as a substitute for handwriting, considering the convenience of workers. Living in a fast-paced and hectic society renders it difficult for youngsters to find extra time to work on personal things, such as writing diaries or practising calligraphy alone, which are time-consuming. Instead, they are inundated with an influx of instant messaging tools by typing on the keyboard within a short time. Furthermore, adopting digital tools is a prevalent and official way to communicate because they are widespread adoption methods. To illustrate, because of technological development, handwritten has been superseded by email services, regarded as the only way to communicate, as exemplified by email format, which is compulsory for most workers to report their work progress to employers. Hence, digital technology plays an increasingly pivotal role in our individual and professional lives concerning its unsubstituted features. Conversely, others underscore that handwriting skills should not be perceived as outdated but supplementary to our lives. For one thing, in terms of special occasions, people have no choice but to write by hand; this method requires individuals to sign some contracts requiring private validation. For example, only if inhabitants adopt handwritten documents to their Ontario leasing agreements can they receive binding documentation simultaneously to guarantee their private rights are protected. Another thing is that students still undergo formal training to put their academic answers on paper at times, as is exemplified by standardized language assessments, such as IELTS or TOEFL, which still highly demand language learners to have the ability to take notes by handwriting. If test takers were frustrated by their terrible calligraphy styles, they would receive lower scores than writing neatly. In conclusion, while online technology has changed the ways people's language output most of the time, I firmly believe that the emphasis on writing remains crucial in many meaningful contexts, especially in academia.",

    "essay": "In several countries, a significant portion of the population opts to rent their homes instead of buying them. This trend has both advantages and disadvantages, which will be discussed in this essay. One of the main advantages of renting a home is the flexibility it offers. Renters can easily relocate for job opportunities, personal reasons, or lifestyle changes without the burden of selling a property. For instance, young professionals who frequently move for career advancement may find renting more suitable. Additionally, renting often requires a lower initial financial commitment compared to buying a house. Instead of a substantial down payment, renters typically only need to cover a security deposit and the first month’s rent. This makes housing more accessible, especially for those who cannot afford to purchase a property. Another benefit is that renters are generally not responsible for maintenance and repair costs. Landlords typically handle these expenses, which can be a significant financial relief. For example, if a major appliance breaks down or the roof needs repairs, the landlord bears the cost, not the tenant. This can result in fewer unexpected expenses and a more predictable budget for renters. However, there are also notable disadvantages to renting a home. One major drawback is the lack of long-term investment. When renting, monthly payments contribute to the landlord’s equity rather than building the tenant’s own wealth. Over time, this can result in substantial financial loss. Homeowners, on the other hand, build equity and can benefit from property appreciation. Moreover, renters may face instability and uncertainty. Lease agreements are typically short-term, and there is always the possibility that a landlord may decide to sell the property or raise the rent. This can lead to frequent moves and disruptions. For example, a family may be forced to move out of their rental home if the landlord decides to sell the property or significantly increase the rent. Additionally, renters often have limited control over their living environment. They may not be able to make significant changes or improvements to the property without the landlord’s permission. This can be frustrating for those who wish to personalize or upgrade their living space. For instance, renters may not be allowed to paint walls, remodel the kitchen, or make other alterations that would make the home more comfortable and suited to their preferences. In conclusion, while renting a home offers advantages such as flexibility, lower upfront costs, and relief from maintenance expenses, it also has disadvantages including lack of investment, potential instability, and limited control over the property. Individuals should carefully consider their personal circumstances and long-term goals when deciding whether to rent or buy a home.",

Hence the smoking person should respect the others especially, if the place was crowded, besides, there are alot of people suffering from Asthma or having difficulty in breathing.

    "essay": "It is clear that Western movies have a significant impact on other nations' films. The debate surrounding whether governments should allocate substantial funds to their creative industries in order to embrace their own cultures or not has sparked considerable controversy. However, this essay agrees with this sentiment due to the reasons the upcoming paragraphs elaborate on. To begin with, including traditional elements in movies is a great alternative to preserve our indigenous culture, which is vitally important for maintaining our heritage. Consecutively, this could offer insight into our nation to visitors, hence ameliorating the economic and tourism sectors. Take Korean drama as the perfect example to encapsulate this notion, people around the world started to try a variety of Korean food such as kimchi and ramen after they consumed numerous Korean media. This proves that we could exchange cultures through screenplays. In essence, film is a powerful medium for expressing cultural values and telling the stories of a community. Furthermore, there is a multitude of juveniles who opt to pursue their tertiary levelAdd a hyphentertiary-levelshow examples education in film-oriented courses, therefore it is crucial for them to receive sufficient learning materials, including top-notch educators. This is to ensure that our unique traditions and customs are passed down to future generations and restrict them from being forgotten. One instance that exemplifies this is the nomination of Mat Kilau for the Grammy Award, a renowned Malaysian film that includes history and tradition. In other words, providing ample resources to the film sector could encourage the involvement of youngsters in this industry. In conclusion, in light of what has been discussed, I concur with the viewpoint that the government should take responsibility for the film industry by offering them numerous revenues and resources. It is worth noting that by improving this burgeoning sector, our culture could be well-known by foreigners and motivate youngsters to have a flourish passion in this course.",

    "essay": "Every year, several languages die out, a phenomenon that elicits diverse opinions on itsCorrect pronoun usagetheirshow examples importance. Some people argue that fewer languages would simplify life and improve global communication, while others believe that the loss of languages erodes cultural heritage and identity. This essay explores both sides of the argument and offers a nuanced perspective on the significance of language preservation. One of the primary arguments in favorChange the spellingfavourshow examples of having fewer languages is the facilitation of global communication. As English increasingly becomes a global lingua franca, it enhances international understanding and cooperation. Tourists, for instance, can travel more easily when a common language reduces language barriers, encouraging tourism and fostering cross-cultural interactions. Moreover, a common language can create more economic opportunities. It simplifies business operations, reduces translation costs, and boosts international trade by making it easier for companies to operate across borders. For language learning institutions, the dominance of a global language like English can attract more students eager to learn a language that opens up vast employment opportunities. Educational systems also benefit from fewer languages. Standardizing curriculums and assessments becomes more straightforward, and resources can be focused on fewer languages, improving the quality of education. In technology and science, a common language accelerates innovation and collaboration, as researchers can share and build on each other's work without language barriers. Despite the practical benefits, the loss of languages comes with significant cultural and social costs. Languages are intrinsic to cultural identity and heritage, encapsulating traditions, histories, and values. When a language dies, the unique cultural insights and wisdom it carries are often lost forever. This diminishes the richness of human diversity and the collective knowledge of humanity. Language is also a crucial aspect of personal and group identity. Losing one's language can lead to a loss of community and individual identity, resulting in social and psychological issues. For elderly and rural populations who may not speak dominant languages well, this can lead to marginalization, making it difficult for them to access services and participate fully in society. Furthermore, bilingualism and multilingualism offer cognitive benefits, such as improved executive function, problem-solving skills, and mental flexibility. The reduction in language diversity could limit these advantages, depriving individuals of the mental benefits associated with learning and using multiple languages. While the practical benefits of fewer languages are significant, the cultural and social costs of losing languages are profound and irreplaceable. It is essential to find a balance that acknowledges both the need for global communication and the importance of preserving linguistic diversity. Encouraging multilingualism alongside a global lingua franca like English can help achieve this balance, allowing societies to reap the benefits of ease of communication while preserving their cultural heritage. In conclusion, the debate over the importance of language loss is complex, with valid arguments on both sides. While a common language can simplify global communication and create economic opportunities, the loss of languages also means losing cultural heritage, identity, and valuable knowledge. Striking a balance between these competing interests is crucial for fostering a globally connected yet culturally rich and diverse world.",

However, critics do not agree with this statement and say that humans should be given permission to choose their dress code. This essay will delve into the benefits of both viewpoints and will lead to a logical conclusion as well. To begin with, the most prominent reason behind adopting a specific dress code is that it helps to bring unity among the team members because it encourages to blur the line between rich and poor people. Besides, motivation is another phenomenon which is maintained among team members through uniforms. Moreover, schools also follow the standard dress code because they want to eliminate cultural as well as financial boundaries among all learners. On the flip side, it is not possible for all individuals to afford uniforms due to lack of money, therefore, it becomes a daunting task for some to do so. Different organizations support different dresses thus, it is not possible for some to buy them. Furthermore, dressing style represents the personality of people which gets lost when followed by any particular dressing style. Thus, it is apparent to say why many are against this trend. In my opinion, it is relentlessly vital to follow a particular dress whether it is a learning or employment institution because it supports to enhance the morale as well as sense of achievement of common goals among the different institutes. It also assists in making humans more attractive and brings unity among them. To conclude, as per the testimonials mentioned above, it is crystal clear that both the approaches have their own advantages but it is more appropriate to adopt theCorrect article usageashow examples similar dress for the people at particular jobs or schools.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, a shortage of drinkable water is becoming a worldwide problem, and many countries have been faced with this ongoing scarcity. This essay will represent several causes and propose potential solutions for this trend. On the one hand, there are numerous problems that can happen due to the lack of fresh water. Initially, clean water plays a pivotal role in humans' lives, as we cannot live without it. However, some people are deprived of this valuable ingredient thanks to polluted H2O from factories and beverage companies. For example, in Africa, most citizens of poverty-stricken countries are suffering from severe diseases because of this predicament. In addition, sterilized water is also an integral part of some species, for this is a natural habitat for a variety of flora and fauna. To be clear, if they lose their natural environment, numerous species will be on the verge of extinction. As a result, other serious difficulties could occur, which would prompt far-reaching effects. On the other hand, there are several solutions that might be taken. Firstly, the government should introduce laws to limit the waste produced by factories, or they should impose heavy fines for irregularities. Moreover, policies should encourage stakeholders in food and drink companies to be environmentally friendly. By doing so, we can provide impoverished citizens with a sufficient aqua supply. Furthermore, individuals should be responsible for solving these issues by using fewer plastic products.Plastic bags are one of the biggest threats to purified water. In the long run, they not only stay in the ocean for thousands of years but also make the ocean creatures victims of this process. In conclusion, although there are a number of problems caused by the absence of water, these issues can be addressed by enforcing some regulations from the government and alerting people to upcoming burdens.",

    "essay": "The shortage of potable water is becoming a controversial issue among worldwide societies and many people are suffering from this ongoing trend. There are numerous causes for this and the intention is to potential solutions for this scarcity. Firstly, one of the causes of the lack of fresh water is that drinkable water plays a crucial role in our lives because we cannot live without it. However, industrial waste, agricultural runoff, and improper sewage disposal are significant contributors to the contamination of water sources, rendering them unusable for human consumption and agricultural purposes. In addition, increasing population leads to higher demand for water for drinking, sanitation, and agriculture. For example, in Africa, many poor people hurting due to this problem which can lead to the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera and dysentery. Consequently, loss of life reduces the workforce, impacting productivity and economic growth. Families may face financial hardship due to medical expenses and loss of income. Furthermore, it has an impact on the environment because over-extraction of limited water resources can lead to environmental damage, such as the drying up of rivers and lakes, loss of biodiversity, and degradation of ecosystems that support human life. On the other hand, there are plenty of solutions for this. Initially, the authority should declare a limit on the waste produced by industry and even for potable purposes. For instance, each individual must be delegated to avoid using plastic because plastic has a detrimental impact on the environment. Moreover, many industries should make drip Irrigation because implementing drip irrigation systems that deliver water directly to the plant roots, minimises wastage. In conclusion, the global freshwater water shortage is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted response, but the collective efforts of individuals, communities, and nations are crucial in addressing this challenge and ensuring the resilience and prosperity of societies worldwide.",

    "essay": "According to some people, that life is difficult in commercial cities while some people think it is more beneficial.In this essay, we will look at the both pros and cons of living life in big cities. To begin with,There are many advantages of living in the cities.In big cities, We can find everything that we need, easily because huge cities have large populations and with the increase in population businesses grow.For instance,My uncle tells me that whenever he visits big cities he buys everything easily from nearby stores and markets and everything is easily and always available. In addition, People have more health facilities like hospitals,pharmacies and laboratories.Pedestrians in cities have easy access to these facilities which are not commonly available in villages.For instance, Ali lives in Karachi, the 6th biggest city in the world. He had a fever last week so his father took him to the hospital nearby he took the medicines and now he is well. There are also some disadvantages of living in the big cities. The major problem of big cities is the polluted environment.It is very hard to find any clean place in big cities and it is not possible for government to clean such a big area.For example,Dallas is a big city but the environment of Dallas is not good The average healthy person can get an illness in a week.It is not possible for the government of the US to clean this big city.Furthermore,Crime rates in big cities are very high as compared to small towns or small villages.To illustrate the news report Karachi have a 15 per cent greater crime rate than any other city. In conclusion, We can easily say that even though there are a lot of benefits to living in big cities but Correct word choiceapplyshow examplesthe disadvantages outweigh the advantages of living in the big cities.",

    "essay": "It is believed that companies should create a comfortable ambience for their employees instead of pressuring them to do well for the business's benefit. I strongly agree with this opinion for the following reasons. On the one hand, making employees happy will help them become more productive. The reason for this is that office pressures often cause a certain amount of stress for employees, which makes them mentally constrained and reduces their concentration. Conversely, when employees are happy, their stress levels will be reduced. Having a workspace where employees feel safe, and comfortable and can manage their stress will lead to higher productivity and efficiency. According to a scientific study, 'happier' companies outperform their competitors by 20% because their employees are more likely to get things done. Furthermore, happiness is associated with creativity and innovation. Happy employees may feel more confident in their abilities, be willing to admit mistakes, and continually try different ways of working. As a result, they may suggest or try new tactics to bring better results to the company. On the other hand, putting pressure on workers does not seem to be better than helping them feel happy. Studies show that unhappy employees are more likely to shut down certain brain functions that are used to gather information and prepare for combat when under stress. Employees are less likely to think creatively, connect emotionally to their work, and feel good about themselves. Consequently, stress can worsen employee health and cause them to fail to perform their jobs, rather than benefiting the company. In conclusion, keeping employees happy can increase the company rather than burdening them. Companies need to create a comfortable environment that makes employees feel like they are at work and increases productivity.",

    "essay": "In the current era, the lack of fresh rain is becoming a significant problem of increasing importance. There are several causes beyond the increasing request for water and it leads to numerous issues that need to be addressed. In addition, several procedures can be accomplished to overcome these challenges. To begin with, the main problem caused by water shortage is restricted access to clean drinking water. This scarcity results in an array of health issues such as the spread of illnesses, dehydration and malnutrition. Moreover, rural production is seriously affected when water availability is inadequate. For instance, if crop yields are minimized, that might lead to decreased food production and raise potential food security issues. Furthermore, water scarcity has detrimental effects on the ecosystem and the environment, posing a threat to biodiversity and the delicate stability of an aquatic ecosystem. Furthermore, several measures need to be taken to mitigate these problems. Firstly, water resource management plans focusing on construction and distribution systems should be implemented by the government. Moreover, public authorities should enforce strict regulations and actions to control industries and stimulate them to practice eco-friendly strategies that promote water conservation. Additionally, Another useful procedure is the utilization of recycled rainwater for non-potable purposes. For instance, recycled rainwater can be used for garden irrigation, landscaping and agricultural purposes. Rainwater can be utilized for flushing toilets in residential, commercial and public buildings as well. In conclusion, the consequences of water shortage could prove injurious to humanity and the biodiversity system. Recycling rainwater as a measure to tackle this phenomenon could significantly contribute to the reduction of freshwater sources and the promotion of sustainable water management.",

I totally agree with the notion that the government should take other aspects into consideration and will discuss both views in the following paragraphs.

To elaborate, funding for the arts broadens the horizon of knowledge of individuals as it provides cultural enrichment and entertainment. Moreover, spending on arts boosts tourism and local business, as resultCorrect article usagea resultshow examples, leads to the economic growth of a particular nation.

On the other hand, I, personally, believe that the housing, and healthcare sectors should be given more priority with respect to funding. Financial support to build more hospitals will improve the quality of life by providing easy access to the nearest hospitals and taking medicine at a lower price. Similarly, by building more houses, people can enjoy their own private space. In turn, spending on these categories will provide more employment opportunities to the needy ones. In conclusion, I totally disagree with the fact that government should spend more on the arts, and believe that other factors such as healthcare and housing should be given more priority.",

They have the same modern language instead of the old-fashioned language from older teachers. Moreover, the middle age teachers are vibrant and active. They will not be exhausted over time. They are energetic and can learn new technology swiftly. Thus, they can utilize it during semesters. One of the sparked examples is Qatar. The country started to import young teachers from neighbouring countries. They believe that this method can enhance the education system. On the other hand, old-age teachers are more experts. They have taught for a long period. They would love to deliver this experience to their descendants. In addition, they can handle the students , especially the less-behaved students. They are more aware of this type of student. For instance, In Egypt, they are hiring overqualified teachers in schools in the rural area. The pupils in these regions are misbehaved and need to be controlled. In conclusion, there will be a debate on this argument. However, It will depend on the area that the teachers will work in. The type of teachers and the years of the working. These all play a crucial role in opting for teachers.",

    "essay": "In today’s modern society, an increasing number of people are choosing to delay parenthood. From my perspective, this tendency arises from several factors, and while it offers some potential advantages, the disadvantages outweigh the benefits. To begin with, there are several reasons why many young married couples opt to have children at older ages. One of the primary reasons for delaying childbirth is the ever-increasing pressure of work and financial responsibilities. As the world has become increasingly competitive, many young individuals find making ends meet a daunting task, let alone bearing the colossal expenses of raising children. Thus, many assert that achieving financial stability before having their first child is of paramount importance, as it allows them to fulfil their parenting responsibilities better. For instance, they will be able to afford quality education and healthcare for their children. Moreover, it is undeniable that parenthood has profound and far-reaching impacts on children’s lives. Therefore, many youngsters believe that postponing parenthood will allow them to accumulate fundamental parenting and caregiving skills, gain a deeper understanding of a child’s characteristics and be able to take good care of their kids in the future. However, I contend that giving birth at an older age has several significant disadvantages. Although great strides in the medical field have improved the safety of childbirth for older mothers, delaying parenthood still poses significant health risks for both mother and child. Research indicates that women over 35 are more susceptible to miscarriage and other issues during laborChange the spellinglabourshow examples. Furthermore, the chances of the child developing health conditions like Down syndrome increase with the mother's age. Moreover, the significant age gap between parents and children can lead to communication difficulties and misunderstandings, potentially undermining family relationships. In conclusion, while the notion of postponing parenthood may allow young couples to prepare more thoroughly for the significant responsibilities of being parents, I still believe its disadvantages overshadow its benefits due to the detrimental effects it may have on mothers, children, and familial relationships.",

    "essay": "A school of thought holds that crime stems from social issues and poverty, while the alternative stance asserts that it is the innate human characteristics that result in criminal acts. From my point of view, while both perspectives have some validity, I believe that socioeconomic factors play a more significant role in driving criminal activity. On the one hand, there are two main reasons why some people feel that an individual's inherent negative traits are the root of crimes. First, they believe that a person with a bad nature has an innate tendency towards violence and law-breaking. For instance, people who lack work ethic and empathy might be more likely to engage in fraudulent acts like scamming or theft as they believe they are above the law. Furthermore, some argue that individuals may commit crimes regardless of their socioeconomic background. To illustrate, there are people in positions of power or wealth committing crimes like embezzlement or financial fraud to maintain their lavish lifestyle or gain further advantage. However, I would side with those who think illicit behaviours take root in social issues, particularly poverty and social inequality. This is because the lack of economic opportunities, social support, and access to education can create a vicious cycle of disadvantage and desperation, leading many citizens to turn to crime as a means of survival or escape from their dire circumstances. For instance, in areas plagued by impoverishment and high unemployment rates, inhabitants may resort to criminal acts like robbery or drug dealing to meet their basic needs or cope with the desperation and lack of prospects. The absence of educational opportunities and social support systems can further exacerbate these challenges, trapping individuals in a never-ending vortex of poverty and crime. In conclusion, while it is undeniable that crime can arise from a person's traits, I still believe that socioeconomic factors are the primary causes of most wrongdoings.",

    "essay": "It is true that in the contemporary world, many individuals tend to work for themselves as freelancers instead of working for companies. There are many reasons why people like to be self-employed. Although there are some advantages to self-employment, it has many drawbacks that people should pay attention to before starting self-employment. Several reasons contribute to why people tend to choose self-employment. Firstly, they have freedom in their job and there is no boss to complain about their work and their approach. Secondly, in many situations, the income can be drastically more than the wages that companies pay. For instance, I have worked for a company for a couple of months as a website developer. When I started to work for myself, I easily made three times more than my salary in just one week. Lastly, people can work at any time of day they want, instead of sticking to a settled working hour. Sometimes it can be devastating and overwhelming to work eight hours a day. Despite all the benefits that self-employment offers, we cannot ignore its drawbacks. In many situations, investors, entrepreneurs, and businessmen do not trust freelancers, instead, they tend to work with big and reputable companies and conglomerates. Also, In diverse situations, such as recession and other economic issues, getting a project would be so hard. For instance, I remember vividly that during Corona pandemic, it was too tough for freelancers to get projects every day. Similarly, self-employers should bear all the burdens alone. When people work as a team, they work together to solve problems related to their jobs. However, this cannot be true for self-employers. In conclusion, there are many reasons why people choose to work for themselves instead of participate in company occupations. While self-employment has a lot of benefits, it faces many obstacles and drawbacks.",

    "essay": "Ambition is widely regarded as a crucial trait for achieving success in contemporary society. This quality, characterised by a strong desire to reach one's goals and aspirations, plays a significant role in driving individuals toward their desired outcomes. Its importance can be examined from various perspectives, including personal motivation, career progression, and overall societal impact. This essay will discuss the essential ways of ambition to excel in life. Firstly, ambition acts as a powerful motivator for individuals. It instils a sense of purpose and direction, encouraging people to set and pursue challenging goals. For instance, individuals with high levels of ambition are more likely to take initiative, overcome obstacles, and persist in the face of setbacks. This relentless drive not only enhances their chances of achieving personal success but also fosters a proactive approach to problem-solving and growth. Moreover, ambition is essential for career advancement. In the competitive job market, those who demonstrate a strong sense of ambition often stand out to employers. Ambitious individuals are typically more willing to invest time and effort into their professional development, seek out opportunities for advancement, and contribute innovative ideas. As a result, they are more likely to secure promotions and achieve leadership roles, thereby shaping their careers positively. Furthermore, ambition can have a broader societal impact by inspiring and influencing others. Ambitious individuals often serve as role models, showcasing the benefits of hard work and perseverance. Their success stories can motivate others to adopt similar attitudes, fostering a culture of aspiration and excellence within communities. However, it is important to acknowledge that ambition must be balanced with other qualities, such as ethical behaviour and empathy. Unchecked ambition can lead to negative consequences, including unethical practices or neglect of personal relationships. Therefore, while ambition is a valuable trait, it should be pursued with consideration for its potential impacts on both oneself and others. In conclusion, ambition is a vital quality for those seeking success in today’s world. It provides the motivation necessary to pursue and achieve personal and professional goals, and it can positively influence society by setting examples of determination and resilience. Nevertheless, it is crucial for individuals to balance their ambition with ethical considerations to ensure that their pursuit of success does not come at a detrimental cost.",

    "essay": "Residing in a nation where a foreign language is necessary can lead to significant social and professional challenges. Although this trend assists individuals in personal growth, I agree with the statement due to the number of problems it causes, including communication barriers and employment challenges. Living overseas can cause significant issues in daily life, such as social isolation. This can be attributed to communication limitations that people face every day. For instance, it can be difficult to communicate with local residents while shopping or ordering a meal in a prestigious restaurant. These difficulties contribute to feelings of loneliness and homesickness. From my personal experience, when I visited Italy, I confronted many issues related to language difficulties. I could not even order fast food, which made the experience worse. This issue is compounded by career hurdles. It is apparent that if an employee has not mastered the local language, it becomes impossible to converse and negotiate with potential customers. Furthermore, millions of immigrants opt to return to their homeland due to unemployment in many countries. However, the outcomes of this trend should not be overlooked. First, it contributes to personal development by increasing resilience, adaptability to new environments, and problem-solving skills. By tackling issues regularly, individuals become more prepared for future challenges. Secondly,In foreign nations, they are exposed to different traditions and cuisines.Hence, people boundAdd a missing verbare boundshow examples to broaden their horizons through cultural interaction.

In contrast, a large number of critics show that it actually leads to complicated conditions and people supposedly get away from the facility. Additionally, I personally disagree that the machinery arouses the aforementioned issue; likewise, this machine is responsible for human development easily. To begin with, the advanced discovery of such a robot possibly provides a superb way to be more productive. According to credible data, a company is able to turn out its products lighter by utilizing artificial intelligence. For instance, nowadays, proofreading services can do paraphrasing and writing by engaging numerous modern tools such as Grammarly and Quillbot without spending a lot of energy and time. Furthermore, technology might help people foster their cognitive skills effectively; meanwhile they are attending a lecture at a university. While young students bite the bullet on a topic and are required to bring up a solution, an online platform such as Chatgpt will corroborate in detail even better than a lecturer. For instance, this app apparently provides a stunning syllabus, which stimulates pupils to have critical thinking and problem-solving. As a result, this way cannot be neglected anymore and it could improve the fundamental academic. To sum up, literally, automation does not make human life harder; however, it is precisely handy for generating positive sides, encompassing boosting industry productivity and facilitating a course for young people. Moreover, in my point of view, the potential for human development through technology is significant and should not be overlooked.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, the concept of happiness distinct from one era to another. Thus, there is a debate on the causes the happiness. A diverse range of individuals believe that happiness is connected to the economic system. While others are convinced that it depends on other factors. I have a balanced opinion on this argument. In this essay, I will elaborate on my view. To commence with, there are a lot of burdens and commitments raised. These things made people suffer. Therefore, they are waiting for motivation and their peer to foster them. They can give support in disparate ways such as financial and motivation. New research from Cairo University illustrates that individuals who are motivated by peers. They are more productive and helpful. Moreover, they can be delighted by other persons outside the circle of family members. For instance, successful companies have good managers. The manager assists his coworkers and interacts with them as their family. Furthermore, high salaries made people feel ecstatic. They are convinced they are able to obtain or handle any method. In addition, they will not be aware of bills. They can purchase a lot of things. One of the sparked instances is Bronai. The Embrator of Bronai supported his people financially. The people's feelings for their Highness are meaningful. Moreover, low taxes and mitigated inflation are sources of success. For instance, Gulf countries like Oman and KSA governments do not charge their people taxes. The people feel proud of their government and leaders. In conclusion, happiness will be different from one community to another. However, the government should be aware of their society. They should impose all sources and efforts to improve the community.",

I believe that the primary aim of science should be to improve people’s lives, as it has become more advanced and capable of addressing human problems through technological development. This essay will discuss why science should be beneficial for humankind. To begin with, science in the modern era supports and enhances individuals’ lives, especially through the use of gadgets and technology. Technological advancements are grounded in scientific knowledge and have been developed using computer science to analyze people's emotions and activities. For instance, scientists invented the cell phone using scientific principles and continually improved its functionality to meet the needs of individuals. These innovations have significantly impacted communication, making it more efficient and accessible. Furthermore, science is not only used in information technology but also plays a vital role in medical fields, helping to diagnose and treat diseases. The application of scientific principles has greatly improved healthcare, providing more effective treatments compared to those available to previous generations. For example, our ancestors lacked advanced scientific knowledge, resulting in less effective medical treatments and reliance on traditional methods. Today, scientific advancements have led to the development of sophisticated medical technologies and treatments, improving overall health outcomes. In conclusion, science should be a central focus in every generation as it has the potential to greatly benefit people's lives. With continued development, science can advocate for better living conditions and address various challenges. I believe that if governments implement supportive regulations and fund scientific research, it will lead to national improvement and sustainability.",

In this essay, I shall elaborate on also I shall reveal my point of view according to this issue. To begin with, generally speaking about immigration considers as a matter hasing pors and cons. Alot of folks prefer the idea of leaving own country. Thus, to seek for stability, safe, and good quality life style, therefore, they encourge the whole human to dispense of the motherland as well as they are accepting to be a foreigners in another province. For example: the war in Iraq and Syria obligated most of the citizen to leave their homes and jobs to another static and stabile countries. As I see from my opinion, it is clear that the first reason is the safe, secondly, the quality of life style. Furthermore, studying and job offers also those parciptates in increasing in the persantage of the number of immigrants. On the other hand, the pattern of travelling from different countries as well as the diversity in the coins and economic state between the arrival and the recipient has a significant effect on the economic state of the recipient city, additionally, this will upgrade the working_hand in the different fields for example: in 80s Iraq open the door for the Egyptian farmers to work in Iraq , consequently, the income of the crops rises and the economic statue of the state. Moreover, the mixture of different cultures will also parciptate in growing up the recipient country. In the nutshell, some humankind encourage the immigration while others dislike this idea. Hence, they see the investment is better in the motherland rather than a foreigon nation.This is a controversial concept, and overall, it is a life saving in the first degree. I concur with the immigration when there is a source of risk on the person's life.",

However, there are both pros and cons of residing in cities . In this essay , I will discuss why some people believe that city life is tough and also its benefits. Let us begin by looking at the advantages of city life . One of the main positives of city life is the better quality of study. What I mean to say is that in modern societies, educational centres are very well and offer diverse courses . Thus , by living in the city we can easily fulfil our study dreams . For example, in urban centres, people admit their children to top-class schools for better schooling because in those schools teachers are highly educated and trained. Secondly , city life offers a wide range of jobs. Moreover. career development opportunities are also available because in big cities there are many companies that hire workers every month . For instance, I live in Islamabad the capital of Pakistan , which offers me a wide range of options to choose my career . On the other hand , city life also has certain demerits . Firstly, people in cities face many environmental challenges such as air pollution, water pollution ,noise pollution and so on.For example, in 2021, in Siri Lanka, about 65% population suffered from cholera due to the utilization of polluted water . Furthermore, by living in cities, people lose the qualities of humanity.They mostly remain busy in their professional life . Their only aim is to earn money and they do not pay heed to what is happening around as a result they become arrogant and selfish. To conclude, life in a big city is not a cup of tea . People face certain problems such as pollution and noise but it has many advantages such as better education and career facilities. I personally believe that the advantages of city life outweigh the negatives.",

    "essay": "There are multiple factors involved in job selection, ranging from an excellent profile to sheer luck. It can be argued that the meeting forms a crucial part of the hiring process, but I do not agree that it is the most important. I contend that the individual’s achievements and professional experience of the candidate are more significant in this process. To begin with, academic performance is highly regarded in the selection criteria among job applicants. Companies give importance to college rankings, grade sheets and letters of recommendation. For instance, in IIT Bombay, a premier engineering institute in India, the highest job offers often go to top students with exceptional gradesheets. This seems to demonstrate that even if a candidate aces the oral account, they might still fall short of someone who ranked first in class. A second criterion for selecting an individual is the amount of past experience they have in their desired field. Many young graduates, for example, fail to secure jobs owing to a lack of experience. This is extremely prevalent in the medical field, where this is strictly enforced. Here, speaking skills will be no good if the person lacks expertise in how to operate on a patient. However, good interviewing ability is definitely helpful as employers can judge the character of the individual they are hiring. To illustrate this point, many American residency programs conference candidates with similar profiles to find the best fit, based on the applicant’s personality. Although it is essential, an excellent record cannot get someone hired without the required education qualifications. In conclusion, I reiterate that having a good command over the statement is beneficial, but cannot be compared to the advantages of being a university topper and research years spent sharpening skills. By striking a balance between professional milestones as well as in-person communication during interviews, an applicant can achieve",

This essay will represent several causes and propose potential solutions for this trend. On the one hand, there are numerous problems that can happen due to the lack of fresh water. Initially, clean water plays a pivotal role in humans' lives, as we cannot live without it. However, some people are deprived of this valuable ingredient thanks to polluted H2O from factories and beverage companies. For example, in Africa, most citizens of poverty-stricken countries are suffering from severe diseases because of this predicament. In addition, sterilized water is also an integral part of some species, for this is a natural habitat for a variety of flora and fauna. To be clear, if they lose their natural environment, numerous species will be on the verge of extinction. As a result, other serious difficulties could occur, which would prompt far-reaching effects. On the other hand, there are several solutions that might be taken. Firstly, the government should introduce laws to limit the waste produced by factories, or they should impose heavy fines for irregularities. Moreover, policies should encourage stakeholders in food and drink companies to be environmentally friendly. By doing so, we can provide impoverished citizens with a sufficient aqua supply. Furthermore, individuals should be responsible for solving these issues by using fewer plastic products.Plastic bags are one of the biggest threats to purified water. In the long run, they not only stay in the ocean for thousands of years but also make the ocean creatures victims of this process. In conclusion, although there are a number of problems caused by the absence of water, these issues can be addressed by enforcing some regulations from the government and alerting people to upcoming burdens.",

    "essay": "In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the amount of time children spend watching television, which resulted in a considerable decrease in the level of physical activities and creative engagements. There are several reasons for this, and to address it ask for actions that can be done by parents and schools. One of the primary reasons why youngsters spend more time on TV programs than they used to is the increased availability and variety of digital entertainment they can offer. To clarify, With the proliferation of cable channels, streaming services like Netflix, and on-demand content, children have access to indulge their needs by watching numerous programs and movies. Another contributing factor is the busy lifestyle of modern families. Many parents have hectic work schedules and family responsibilities parents, which leaves them with limited time to engage in activities - require creativity and active engagement - with their offspring. However, several measures can be implemented by parents to reverse this contemporary trend and encourage children to be more active and creative. Firstly, parents should set clear limits on screen time and offer alternative activities to cater to their interests. For example, they can establish daily routines that include football or basketball as outdoor activities playing board games as indoor ones, going for a walk, and exercising at home. Having a routine is not enough to keep a child motivated to do something good, so the time they spend together to give a child emotional support must be considered by parents as well. In addition, schools would have a lot to offer to make kids more active and creative thinkers, as they spend half of their day in these places. For example, encouraging students to take part in an array of competitions, adding curriculums, and establishing creative workshops can force youngsters to be active and think outside the box. In conclusion, the rise in television watching among schoolchildren and the noticeable decline in terms of physical and creative activities can be attributed to available and entertaining digital content along with the lack of parental attention due to the modern lifestyles of parents. To tackle the problem, caregivers and schools must work together to create an environment that values creativity and physical activity.",

This view is well-intentioned, yet l somewhat disagree. Of course, reverting to some of the simplicities of the past may be positive, with one being growing our own food locally or at home. Instead of expecting perennial access to produce like exotic seafood or tropical fruits and vegetables, people could return to consuming only those things that are endemic to their areas and available seasonally, thereby dramatically reducing their food miles and the overexploitation of natural resources, and ultimately shrinking their carbon footprint. In many new urban residential developments now, planners factor in rooftop or community gardens, allowing even those restricted by high densityAdd a hyphenhigh-densityshow examples living sapceCorrect your spellingspace to cultivate herbs, leafy greens and suitable fruit. This means residents generally rely less on imported or shipped-in fresh food. However, solutions to such problems need not, l believe, require simplifying our lifestyles. An obvious reason is the emergence of electric vehicles. With a broadening range of affordable options coming online, people from all walks of life can maintain the comfort a car provides them and simultaneously, lower their dependence on contaminative fossil fuels, which are major contributors to global warming. Another is we can continue to replace coal and natural gas with renewable energy, enabling us to power our homes and businesses without interruptions or limits. Indeed, right now China is the world's largest manufacturer of solar panels, satisfying the increasing demand for photovoltaic technology in many countries. As such, homes and factories can carry on using the appliances and machines that serve them best without significant changes.

    "essay": "In recent years, the number of older generations has increased significantly. While some individuals believe their presence might cause numerous difficulties for governments, others and I believe elder generations are beneficial for governments and families. On the one hand, the advocates, including me, suggest that elder people have a wealth of knowledge and precious experiences. Furthermore, they are the best mentors for children. It is noteworthy that children have their support and assistance in dealing with problems that they face in their personal and professional lives. In addition, with these expert or knowledgeable people, governments can save money, though they shouldn’t allocate excessive budgets to training the young; therefore, those budgets can be spent on other prominent projects. Families are also assisted by their grandparents to reduce the costs of life. For example, children spend their time with grandparents; thus, parents do not have to pay for children’s kindergartens. On the other hand, with the ageing population, they are more likely prone to a variety of diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, dementia and Alzheimer's. In an optimistic view, this issue can create more job opportunities for youngsters. However, it can put an excessive burden on governments’ shoulders. Additionally, most elders are patient and have a deep understanding of life. They reach this valuable trait throughout their lives. As a result, they can direct the societies towards having peace and calm temper in the long run. These days, people spend most of their time at the workplace or commuting in cars or other transportation vehicles, so children should be alone and away from their parents. In this situation, grandparents are also the best friends for grandchildren to upbringing them. In a nutshell, although old individuals impose several detrimental consequences, I wholeheartedly believe the presence of these kind creatures in our lives is of paramount importance which I have elaborated on in this essay.",

For all that, around seventy per cent of the earth is covered with rain, but only fifteen per cent of that is usable. There are many possible solutions to this problem, which will be discussed in the subsequent paragraphs. Initially, the main difficulty caused by a shortage of water is limited access to clean drinking rain, such as the absence of fresh drink industries. To give an example, one of the fundamental reasons for this problem is that a lack of drinking unclean water might lead to different health issues such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid. In addition, another reason for this is that the scarcity of clean water also affects the agricultural system as well as the financial resources of countries. For instance, agriculture relies heavily on water for irrigation, and shortages of suitable liquid can lead to reduced crop yields, food shortages, and increased food prices. Furthermore, several measures need to be taken to overcome this problem. First of all, governments and regulatory authorities must improve water management, and developing better infrastructure for water storage, distribution, and treatment can help ensure that water resources are used more effectively, reach those in need, and reduce individual diseases. Secondly, the primary solution to this problem is water conservation. For instance, society has developed a rainwater harvesting technique to collect rainwater and use it for various purposes, like agriculture. Hence, implementing efficient water use practices in agriculture, industry, and households can significantly reduce water waste.

    "essay": "Deforestation caused by human activities is happening in many regions all over the world, with serious results for the environment. Personally, I believe that this problem can be solved in some ways which I shall explain in more detail in this essay. To begin, we can see that today, many parts of the world are suffering negative effects on both the lives of residents and their properties due to natural disasters such as floods, droughts, earthquakes and so on. For example, recently, an earthquake in Japan destroyed a city, moreover, it took the lives of hundreds of individuals away. Another case in my country, Vietnam had a huge flood a few months ago. Although all people were safe life but houses, streets, crops and cattle were damaged seriously. It is clear that deforestation has brought lots of difficulties to our lives. Therefore, stopping deforestation is a great way to protect the environment as well as prevent natural disasters. On the other hand, I think that the problem caused by deforestation can be addressed by the government's practical actions. Firstly, they should produce force laws to control deforestation activities. For example, these years, the Vietnamese government has promulgated a rule that if a person demolishes the trees in the forest, he or she will be punished by imprisonment for up to 50 years. Since this law has been practised, the number of criminal deforestation has decreased significantly. Secondly, the increase in the size of forests to alter for one which is cut is a key point, hence, the planting of trees in forests should be encouraged. To illustrate, in my country, the power has hired local people to plant trees in forests. This not only helps to increase the size and security of the forest areas but also provides fine jobs for residents, so, they can cover the cost of living and reduce the risk of the poor cutting the trees in the forest to earn money. In conclusion, in this essay, I would like to convey the message that forests are very important for our habitat. It helps us to prevent natural disasters. Thus, the government should produce grave laws to punish those who destroy forests to stop deforestation.Additionally, they should also encourage local families to plant trees in forests to make good the consequences of deforestation.",

    "essay": "In the era of globalisation, the rate of male employees skyrocketed, while the number of females plunged. There is a wide range of reasons for this phenomenon. Nevertheless, mothers opted for the family among the work and money. Therefore, a diverse range of individuals believe that the government should pay for their sacrifice. I totally agree with this argument. In this essay, I will elaborate on my view. To commence with, the commitments increased recently. The parents are struggling, as a result of the inflation, thus one salary is not enough to build a house or raise a child. For instance, Egypt is one of the highest countries illustrating inflation. All family members are working to improve their level. In addition, most of the women nowadays are educated. They also have obtained their certification. However, they are convinced that their home and children are more essential than anything else. On the other hand, they are raising their kids. They want to raise their kids and make them well-developed. Moreover, the government should respect them. They educated hard. Nonetheless, they believe that family comes first. Moving further, the government should subsidise their financial products. It can offer them home-working jobs. The government also can raise taxes for affluent individuals. One of the sparked examples is Dubai. the women there were not working, so the Prince of Dubai implemented a rule to increase the taxation on wealthy persons and cut a part of it for these women. In conclusion, the government must be aware of married women. They sacrificed for the family and society. They know that if the good earned a good pedagogical they will enhance the community in the future.",
